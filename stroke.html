    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. 
      Early identification of individuals at high risk is critical for timely interventions 
      and preventive care. Traditional screening methods are limited in scalability 
      and accuracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Aim</h2>
    <p>
      To develop a machine learningâ€“driven prediction model that identifies individuals 
      at high risk of stroke using key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, 
      BMI, and glucose levels, enabling proactive healthcare planning.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collected and cleaned patient health records.</li>
      <li>Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.</li>
      <li>Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for prediction.</li>
      <li>Evaluated performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
      <li>Fine-tuned models and generated explainable insights for healthcare providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
    <p><b>Python Â· Statistics Â· Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) Â· Tableau Â· Feature Engineering</b></p>

    <h2>Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Enabled healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients early, improving 
      preventive care, reducing hospital admissions, and potentially lowering treatment costs.
