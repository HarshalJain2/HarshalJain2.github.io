    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      E-commerce businesses often face late deliveries due to logistics inefficiencies, 
      leading to customer dissatisfaction, increased returns, and higher operational costs. 
      Predicting potential delays before shipment can significantly improve order fulfillment.
    </p>

    <h2>Aim</h2>
    <p>
      To design a machine learning system that predicts the risk of delayed deliveries 
      using historical order and logistics data, enabling proactive intervention and 
      improved supply chain planning.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collected and preprocessed historical order and delivery data.</li>
      <li>Engineered features such as delivery distance, shipping method, and order size.</li>
      <li>Built classification models to predict late vs. on-time deliveries.</li>
      <li>Evaluated models with accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall metrics.</li>
      <li>Deployed insights to support logistics and operations teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
    <p><b>Python Â· SQL Â· AWS (S3, Glue, Athena) Â· Machine Learning Â· Feature Engineering Â· Data Analysis</b></p>

    <h2>Business Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Improved on-time delivery rates, reduced return costs, and enhanced customer 
      satisfaction, ultimately contributing to higher profitability for e-commerce operations.
